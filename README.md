Sleep Health EDA
This project presents a structured exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a sleep health and lifestyle dataset (374 individuals).
Objective
To investigate relationships between lifestyle factors and sleep disorders, and to identify potential high-risk profiles for preliminary insurance screening.
Dataset Features
Demographics: Age, Gender, Occupation
Lifestyle: Sleep Duration, Physical Activity Level, Stress Level, Daily Steps
Health Metrics: BMI Category, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate
Target Variable: Sleep Disorder (None, Insomnia, Sleep Apnea)
Key Analysis Areas
Data cleaning and feature engineering (blood pressure split, pulse pressure)
Univariate and bivariate analysis
Correlation analysis
Risk profiling based on stress, sleep duration, and BMI
Key Insights
Higher stress levels and shorter sleep duration show meaningful association with sleep disorders.
Physical activity demonstrates a mild protective pattern.
High-risk individuals (based on combined lifestyle indicators) show higher prevalence of sleep disorders.
Tools Used
Python
Pandas
